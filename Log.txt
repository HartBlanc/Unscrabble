Pre 1st Feb:
    Created a viable functioning program without reading other peoples solutions

1st Feb:

2 second, 750kb solver
    http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/jacobson+appel/aj.pdf


Will attempt to implement this solution as follows:
    1. dawg data structure
     a) start with trie [DONE]
     b) reduce using hopcrofts algorithm
    2. anchor squares
    3. cross checks and cross scores
    4. backtracking algorithm
    5. score calculation
    6. account for wildcards

Whilst implementing this solution I will attempt to take a much more Object
Orientated approach.
